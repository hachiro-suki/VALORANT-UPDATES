<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 250%;"><em>&nbsp; GAMEPLAY</em></h1>
  <p style="color: white; font-size: 100%;">
    <b>
     Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around 
     the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each 
     requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol 
     and one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the 
     previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns 
     like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be 
     controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. It currently offers 19 agents to choose from.They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, 
     Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, Neon, and Fade.

  </p>
<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 250%;"><em>&nbsp; UNRATED</em></h1>
  <p style="color: white; font-size: 100%;">
    <b>
     In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must 
     deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying 
     everything in a specific area, and they receive a point. If the defending team can deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, 
     the defending team receives a point.[10] If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the spike is 
     activated, the opposing team earns a point.[3] If both teams win 12 rounds, sudden death occurs, in which the winning team of that round wins the match, differing from overtime for competitive 
     matches. Additionally, if after 4 rounds, a team wishes to forfeit that match, they may request a vote to surrender. If the vote reaches 4 (in contrast to 5 for competitive), the winning team 
     gets all the victory credit for every round needed to bring them to 13, with the forfeiting team receiving losing credit.[11] A team gets only three chances to surrender: once in the first half, 
     once in the pistol round of the second half, and once more in the second half.

<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 250%;"><em>&nbsp; SPIKE RUSH</em></h1>
  <p style="color: white; font-size: 100%;">
    <b>
     In the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which 
     charges twice as fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with 
     the same gun. Ultimate point orbs in the standard game are present, as well as multiple different power-up orbs.
    </b>
  </p>
<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 250%;"><em>&nbsp; COMPETITIVE</em></h1>
  <p style="color: white; font-size: 100%;">
    <b>
     Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system that assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Players are required to reach level 20 before 
     playing this mode. In July 2020, Riot introduced a "win by two" condition for competitive matches, where instead of playing a single sudden death round at 12-12, teams will alternate playing rounds on attack 
     and defense in overtime until a team claims victory by securing a two-match lead. Each overtime round gives players the same amount of money to purchase guns and abilities, as well as approximately half of their 
     ultimate ability charge. After each group of two rounds, players may vote to end the game in a draw, requiring 6 players after the first set, 3 after the second, and thereafter only 1 player to agree to a draw. The 
     competitive ranking system ranges from Iron to Radiant. Every rank except for Radiant has 3 tiers. Radiant is reserved for the top 500 players of a region, and both Immortal and Radiant have a number associated to 
     their rank allowing players to have a metric in which they can compare how they rank up to others at their level.

<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 250%;"><em>&nbsp; DEATHMATCH</em></h1>
  <p style="color: white; font-size: 100%;">
    <b>
     The Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020. 14 players enter a 9-minute free-for-all match and the first person to reach 40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins the match. 
     Players spawn in with a random agent as well as full shields, and all abilities are disabled during the match which indulges pure gunplay. Green health packs drop on every kill, which reset the player to maximum health, 
     armor, and give an additional 30 bullets to each of their guns.
    </b>
  </p>
<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 250%;"><em>&nbsp; AGENTS</em></h1>
  <p style="color: white; font-size: 100%;">
    <b>
     There are a large variety of playable agents available in the game. <sup>Agents are divided into 4 roles: Duelists, Sentinels, Initiators, and Controllers</sup>. Each agent has a different role which indicates how the agent is usually played.
    </b>
  </p>
<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 250%;"><em>&nbsp; DUALIST</em></h1>
  <p style="color: white; font-size: 100%;">
    <b>
     Duelists specialize in attacking and entering a bomb site for the team. Riot's official definition for duelists is "self-sufficient fraggers."Duelists mainly create space for their team while entering onto a site, giving their teammates 
     information, and making entering a site easier. Their abilities tend to consist of flashes which blind enemies, and movement-based abilities that allow for them to cover large distances faster than other agents. This type of ability kit allows 
     for duelists to shine best when they are able to catch players off guard and get impact frags. On attack, duelists are most often expected to play forward, leading the attack. They are expected to be in front of everyone to get opening picks on 
     enemies since their abilities often give them a competitive advantage when gunfighting an enemy. On defense, duelists will be holding choke points where enemies try to enter sites. Due to the mobility in their kits, they are able to get a pick 
     and reposition, giving their team a numbers advantage. Duelists include <sup>Jett, Phoenix, Raze, Reyna, Yoru, and Neon</sup>
    </b>
  </p>
<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 250%;"><em>&nbsp; SENTINEL</em></h1>
  <p style="color: white; font-size: 100%;">
    <b>
     Sentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies. Their abilities mainly consist of static 'objects' that are obstacles to the enemies. These objects can give the team valuable information 
     and/or deal damage. On attack, sentinels can use their abilities to cut off certain parts of the map or set up 'objects' that can ensure the enemy cannot flank without being noticed. On defense, sentinels can use their abilities to slow enemies from entering 
     a site. This provides valuable time for the sentinels' team members to come and provide defensive support. Sentinels include <sup>Cypher, Killjoy, and Sage</sup>
    </b>
  </p>
<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 250%;"><em>&nbsp; INITIATOR</em></h1>
  <p style="color: white; font-size: 100%;">
    <b>
     Initiators plan out the offensive pushes. Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy positions. Initiators' abilities can consist of flashes but also abilities that can reveal the location of enemies. This information allows for attackers to know 
     where enemies are and make taking a site easier. On defense, initiators can use their abilities to provide information on where the attackers are going, as well as helping their teammates retake a lost site. Initiators include <sup>Breach, KAY/O, Skye, Sova, and Fade</sup>
    </b>
  </p>
<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 250%;"><em>&nbsp; CONTROLLER</em></h1>
  <p style="color: white; font-size: 100%;">
    <b>
     Controllers specialize in "slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success."They use their abilities to create coverage or clear out areas of space with crowd control. To help their team enter into enemy territory, their abilities consist of 
     some kind of smoke, as well as molotovs, stuns, or flashes. With their smokes, controllers can control sightlines on the map, making it safer to move through the map without getting seen. On offense, controllers can smoke off certain sightlines and use their crowd 
     control on common defensive spots to force enemies into the open. On defense, controllers can smoke and/or use crowd control on entryways to delay or discourage the enemy team from moving forward.Controllers include <sup>Astra, Brimstone, Omen, and Viper</sup>
